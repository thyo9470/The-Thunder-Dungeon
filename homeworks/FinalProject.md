# Final Checkpoint
#### 0) Guide to current functionalities
[See README.md](https://github.com/thyo9470/The-Thunder-Dungeon/blob/master/README.md)
#### 1) Previous plan:
Up until now, we’ve been trying to implement a ton of features and mechanics, so it will likely not look too great and it probably won’t be balanced enough for fun gameplay. So, we will focus on refining and polishing the graphics, sound, and gameplay. 
- Add the main menu.
- Add game over and winning
- Ideally, we are not adding any more features, but getting the game ready as a product.
- Preparing for project presentation.
- Basic sound and animation
- More items, show item skill description
#### 2) Our Progress
- Add the main menu
    - Simple main menu is done!
- Add game over and winning
    - Simple game over and winning user flows done!
- Basic sound and animation
    - We have simple battle fx and background music
    - We have battle animations
- More items, show item skill description
    - Item skill description now shows
    - We have about 40 base items before they are randomly altered in the item factory
- Additional Polishing
    - Faster tooltip (from user tests)
    - More ways to recover health (from user tests)
    - Better enemy spawning
    - Chests spawn in the dungeon
    - Better project README

#### 3) Next Checkpoint:
Overall, we are very happy with how our project has turned out. We didn't have to cut a whole lot of features, and the game works smoothly, and the architecture has been holding together well.
Next: to Unity and beyond!
